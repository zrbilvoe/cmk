description:
 This checks monitors a FibreChannel port of switch using FIBRE-CHANNEL-FE-MIB.
 The check goes critical under the following conditions:

 {[1]} The physical state, operational state or adminstrative state of the port is not
 as expected.

 {[2]} The current throughput exceeds certain absolute or
 percentual levels.

 {[3]} An error counter exceeds its  configured levels (C3 Discards, Link Failures,
   Sync Losses, Prime Sequence Protocol Errors, Invalid Text Words, Invalid CRCs,
   Address Id Errors, Link Reset Ins, Ols Ins, Ols Outs)

item:
 The item is the switch-number.port-number, with port-number as two-digit or
 three-digit string (on switches with 100 or more ports).

examples:
 # Generally turn on averaging with 15 Minutes on all ports:
 brocade_fcport_default_levels["average"] = 15

 # Alternative: set all default parameters at once:
 fc_port_default_levels = {
    "operstatus"			: [ 2 ], # accept only online.
    "adminstatus"			: [ 2 ], # accept only online.
    "assumed_speed"			: 4,  # assume port is 4Gb/s
    "C3Discards"			: (5.0, 10.0), # allowed percentage of CRC errors
    "LinkFailures"			: (5.0, 20.0), # allowed percentage of Enc-OUT Frames
    "SyncLosses"			: (10.0, 20.0), # allowed percentage of No Tx Credits
    "PrimSeqProtoErrors"	: (10.0, 20.0), # allowed percentage of CRC errors
    "InvalidTxWords"		: (10.0, 20.0), # allowed percentage of CRC errors
    "InvalidCrcs"			: (5.0, 10.0), # allowed percentage of Enc-OUT Frames
    "AddressIdErrors"		: (5.0, 10.0), # allowed percentage of No Tx Credits
    "LinkResetIns"			: (3.0, 20.0), # allowed percentage of CRC errors
    "LinkResetOuts"			: (3.0, 20.0), # allowed percentage of CRC errors
    "OlsIns"				: (3.0, 20.0), # allowed percentage of Enc-OUT Frames
    "OlsOuts"				: (3.0, 20.0), # allowed percentage of No Tx Credits
 }

perfdata:
  For each port there are sent {In}, {Out}, {inframes}, {outframes} and the following
  error counters: {C3Discards}, {LinkFailures}, {SyncLosses}, {PrimSeqProtoErrors},
  {InvalidTxWords}, {InvalidCrcs}, {AddressIdErrors}, {LinkResetIns}, {LinkResetOuts},
  {OlsIns} and {OlsOuts}.  All rates are in Bytes/s or Frames/s.

inventory:
  The inventory creates checks for all operational ports.

[parameters]
parameters (dict): This check works with dictionary based parameters. The
 following keys are allowed:

  {"assumed_speed"}: I could not find a non vendor specific method for detection of the
  link speed. You can set the assumed link speed (in GBit/s) here. (example: {4.0})

  {"C3Discards"}: A pair of percentages of the maximum allowed CRC Discards. The default is set to {(3.0, 20.0)}, which will warn
  at 3% and be critical at 20% of errors.

  {"LinkFailures"}: A pair of percentages for the Link Failures rate. The
  default is {(3.0, 20.0)}.

  {"SyncLosses"}: A pair of percentages for Sync Losses. The default
  is {(3.0, 20.0)}.

  {"PrimSeqProtoErrors"}: A pair of percentages for Prime Sequence Protocal Errors. The default is
  {(3.0, 20.0)}.

  {"InvalidTxWords"}: A pair of percentages for Invalid Tx Words errors. The default is
  {(3.0, 20.0)}.

  {"InvalidCrcs"}: A pair of percentages for Invalid CRCs. The default is
  {(3.0, 20.0)}.

  {"AddressIdErrors"}: A pair of percentages for Address Id Errors. The default is
  {(3.0, 20.0)}.

  {"LinkResetIns"}: A pair of percentages for Link Reset Ins. The default is
  {(3.0, 20.0)}.

  {"LinkResetOuts"}: A pair of percentages for Link Reset Outs. The default is
  {(3.0, 20.0)}.

  {"OlsIns"}: A pair of percentages for Ols Ins. The default is
  {(3.0, 20.0)}.

  {"OlsOuts"}: A pair of percentages for Ols Outs. The default is
  {(3.0, 20.0)}.

  {"operstatus"}: The expected operational (integer) of the port or {None} if that should
  not be checked. It is also allowed to specify a list of allowed states, e.g. {[1, 2, 3]}.

  {"adminstatus"}: The expected administrative state of the port or {None} if that should
  not be checked. It is also allowed to specify a list here.

[configuration]
fc_port_inventory_opermode(list): The list of operational mode inventorized
 ports must have to be inventorized. The default is {[ "2", "3",]}. Possible are:
 {1}: unknown, {2}: fPort, {3}: flPort.
